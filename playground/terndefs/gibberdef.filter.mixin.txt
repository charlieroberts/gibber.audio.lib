"cutoff": {
  "!type": "number__sequencable",
  "!doc": "default: .5. The cutoff property provides a base for determining the cutoff frequency of the filter. The frequency is additionally affected by the envelope of the synth, multiplied by the filterMult property."
},
"Q": {
  "!type": "number__sequencable",
  "!doc": "default: .25 The Q property (also commonly known as resonance) determines the sharpness of the filter. This is canonically accompanied by a boost around the cutoff frequency; if the Q property is high enough this boost can turn into self-oscillation."
},
"filterMult": {
  "!type": "number__sequencable",
  "!doc": "default: 2. The filterMult property determines how much the cutoff frequency is affected by each synth's envelope. The default value of 2 means that a cutoff frequency would move between .25 and .5 over the course of the envelope." 
},
"filterType": {
  "!type": "number",
  "!doc": "default: 1. The filterType property determines what filter modeling algorithm is used. 0 means no filter is applied to the synth, 1 uses a Moog Ladder Filter, 2 uses  a TB303-style diode filter, 3 uses a state variable filter, and 4 uses a biquad filter design." 
},
"filterMode": {
  "!type": "number",
  "!doc": "default: 0. The filterMode property determines the type of filtering employed, however, some filter types do not support highpass or bandpass filtering. 0 = lowpass, 1 = highpass, 2 = bandpass." 
},
"saturation": {
  "!type": "number__sequencable",
  "!doc": "default: .5. Saturation is a waveshaping distortion that is part of the TB303 diode filter model (filterType 2). This property will have no effect for any other value of filterType."
