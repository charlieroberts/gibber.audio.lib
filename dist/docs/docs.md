# Instruments
FM
----
*Prototype: [instrument](#prototypes-instrument)*

The FM object pairs two oscillators (with one modulating the frequency of the other) with an envelope and a filter. The envelope controls the amplitude of the modulator (also known as the modulation index) , the overall gain of the synth (volume), and the cutoff frequency of the filter, making its sound perceptually brighter when the envelope is fully open. The synth's envelope also controls the amount that the modulator's output affects its own frequency (feedback).


#### Properties ####
### FM.cmRatio ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 2, range: 0.01-20.  This controls the ratio between the carrier and modulation frequencies. When a note is trigger on this synth the frequency is assigned to the carrier oscillator; the frequency is then multiplied by this property and assigned ot the modulator.
### FM.index ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 5, range: 0.01-20.  This property value, multiplied by the frequency of the carrier oscillator, determines the amplitude of the modulating oscillator.
### FM.feedback ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 0, range: 0-1.  The modulating oscillator can direct its output to modulate its own frequency, resulting in chaotic and noisy sounds.
### FM.carrierWaveform ###
*string* default: saw.  Controls the waveform of the carrier oscillator. Options include 'saw', 'triangle', 'pwm', 'sine', and 'square'.
### FM.modulatorWaveform ###
*string* default: saw.  Controls the waveform of the carrier oscillator. Options include 'saw', 'triangle', 'pwm', 'sine', and 'square'.
### FM.antialias ###
*boolean* default: true.  When set to true, the synth's oscillators will use higher-quality (but more CPU expensive) anti-aliasing oscillators.
### FM.frequency ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 220, range: 40-8000.  This is the frequency that will be used when the .trigger() method is called, or if you call .note() and pass no argument. Calls to .note() (assuming you pass an argument) will set the value of this property.
### FM.loudness ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 1, range: 0-1.  Loudness linearly controls the output of the signal. In addition, in the FM instrument it also affects the cutoff frequency of the instrument's filter (assuming a filter is active), the amplitude of the modulator, and the amount of feedback applied to the modulator. All these effects correspond to much more complex timbres as the instrument gets louder.
### FM.attack ###
*duration*  The attack property controls the duration it takes for the synth to reach full volume after triggering. The duration is written in measures. A value of 1/4 means one quarter of a measure, a value of 1 means 1 measure.
### FM.decay ###
*duration*  The decay property controls the length of time it takes for the synth to decay to silence after reaching full volume during its attack phase. The duration is written in measures e.g. a value of 1/4 means one quarter of a measure, a value of 1 means 1 measure.
### FM.sustain ###
*duration*  The sustain property controls the length of time the synths envelope stays at steady state after the attack and decay of the envelope have completed. The duration is written in measures e.g. a value of 1/4 means one quarter of a measure, a value of 1 means 1 measure.
### FM.release ###
*duration*  The release determines the amount of time the envelope takes to fade to zero after the sustain portion is complete. The duration is written in measures e.g. a value of 1/4 means one quarter of a measure, a value of 1 means 1 measurei.
### FM.shape ###
*string* default: linear.  Controls the shape of the synth's envelope stages. Choosee between 'linear' and 'exponential'.
### FM.useADSR ###
*boolean* default: false.  When false, the synth uses a two-stage envelope where durations are determined by the attack and decay properties. When true, the synth uses a four-stage envelope.
### FM.cutoff ###
*number__sequencable* default: 0.5, range: 0-1.  The cutoff property provides a base for determining the cutoff frequency of the filter. The frequency is additionally affected by the envelope of the synth, multiplied by the filterMult property.
### FM.Q ###
*number__sequencable*  The Q property (also commonly known as resonance) determines the sharpness of the filter. This is canonically accompanied by a boost around the cutoff frequency; if the Q property is high enough this boost can turn into self-oscillation.
### FM.filterMult ###
*number__sequencable* default: 2, range: 0-10.  The filterMult property determines how much the cutoff frequency is affected by each synth's envelope. The default value of 2 means that a cutoff frequency would move between .25 and .5 over the course of the envelope.
### FM.filterType ###
*number* default: 1.  The filterType property determines what filter modeling algorithm is used. 0 means no filter is applied to the synth, 1 uses a Moog Ladder Filter, 2 uses  a TB303-style diode filter, 3 uses a state variable filter, and 4 uses a biquad filter design.
### FM.filterMode ###
*number* default: 0.  The filterMode property determines the type of filtering employed, however, some filter types do not support highpass or bandpass filtering. 0 = lowpass, 1 = highpass, 2 = bandpass.
### FM.saturation ###
*number__sequencable* default: 0.5, range: 0.5-20.  Saturation is a waveshaping distortion that is part of the TB303 diode filter model (filterType 2). This property will have no effect for any other value of filterType.
### FM.gain ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 0.5, range: 0-1.  This linearly controls the overall output (sometimes known as volume) of the instrument.
### FM.panVoices ###
*boolean* default: true.  When set to true the instrument can be panned through the stereo sound image, adding a slight amount of computational expense.
### FM.pan ###
*number__sequencable* default: 0.5, range: 0-1.  Controls the position of the sound between the left / right speakers or headphones. A value of 0 means the sound is panned to the left, a value of 1 meanns the sound is panned to the right, while .5 is centered.
### FM.glide ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 1, range: 1-4000.  The glide property controls a single-pole lowpass filter on the frequency, causing notes to slide from one to the next (portamento). The filter equation is: y (n) = y (n-1) + ((x (n) - y (n-1))/glide). A value of 1 generates no glide, a value of 1500 generates a substantial glide.

*number(sequencable)* default: 1, range: 0-1.  A feature of the model used for this instrument is that it is easy to randomly add noise to the signal. Values slightly less than 1 will produce notes that sound almost errant, while values closer to .5 will produce bursts of noise and can be a useful percussive texture.
### Pluck.decay ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 0.97, range: 0-1.  Controls the time it takes for each note to fade to silence.
### Pluck.damping ###

### Pluck.frequency ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 220, range: 40-8000.  This is the frequency that will be used when the .trigger() method is called, or if you call .note() and pass no argument. Calls to .note() (assuming you pass an argument) will set the value of this property.
### Pluck.loudness ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 1, range: 0-1.  Loudness linearly controls the output of the signal. In this instrument, there is no difference between loudness and gain.
### Pluck.gain ###

### Pluck.glide ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 1, range: 1-4000.  The glide property controls a single-pole lowpass filter on the frequency, causing notes to slide from one to the next (portamento). The filter equation is: y (n) = y (n-1) + ((x (n) - y (n-1))/glide). A value of 1 generates no glide, a value of 1500 generates a substantial glide.
Monosynth
----

### Monosynth.detune2 ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 0.005, range: -1-1.  The frequency for oscillator #2 will be determined by taking the value of the .frequency property (which controls the frequency of oscillator #1) and offsetting it by the the value of this property multiplied by the base frequency. So, if the base .frqeuency property was 1000 Hz, oscillator #2 would run at a frequency of 1005 Hz using the default value of .005
### Monosynth.detune3 ###
*number(sequencable)* default: -0.005, range: -1-1.

Texture
----
A texture can be applied to a geometry in order to pattern its surface; it can also be used as a lookup table for bump mapping. Unlike materials, every texture has a relatively unique set of properties depending on the algorithm used for the texture. However, the majority of texture will have a 'scale' property which determines the resolution of the texture; many will also have a 'strength' property that scales the effect of the texture on the final color of the geometry (lighting and material also affect this).


#### Properties ####
### Texture.scale ###
*float* default: 1.  The scale property determines the size, or resolution, of the texture. For example, when 'dots' texture is assigned to a cube with a scale of 10 there will be 10x10 dots on each side of the cube. A scale value of 1 will yiled a single dot centered on each side.
